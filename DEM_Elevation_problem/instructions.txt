- Goal: calculate average elevation for segments or clips from the digital
  elevation model geotif
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model)
- Use shapefile features to divide the tif (hint: using the tif's projection)
- Generate output csv with average elevation for each feature in the
  shapefile, labeled by the 'prism_id' metadata column in the shapefile
- Apply "defensive coding" practices to make the solution as robust as
  possible to common data errors
- Suggested libraries: geopandas rasterio
- Submit your code in a public github repository or equivalent
- EXTRA CREDIT: bundle scripts into a docker container that reads from input files mounted
  at '/data/' and writes csv to '/data/average_elevations.csv'.
